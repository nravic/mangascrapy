# mangascrapy
Downloads and zips manga from a range of hosting sites using python and scrapy. Need to modify `settings.py` file under `mangascraper/settings.py` in order to set the desired download directory.

## Currently functioning components
- Can run by invoking `python3 mangascrapy.py` in parent directory. Need to enter URL (from page 1!) and the manga name and ch. no.
- Downloads files to desired folder and renames them to page numbers.
- Auto-zips downloaded images for convenience. 

## To-do
TLDR; a lot. 

- More user-friendly interface.
- Sourcing manga name and chapter number from provided url.
- Support for further manga hosting sites.
- Support for downloading multiple chapters at once. 

## Licensing
Protected under the MIT license. 

TLDR; Do what you want with it, I'm not liable, etc, don't be an ass, etc. etc.
