# mangascrapy
Downloads and zips manga from a range of hosting sites using python and scrapy. Need to modify `settings.py` file under `mangascraper/settings.py` in order to set the desired download directory.

## Currently functioning components
Can currently only run by invoking `scrapy crawl mangastream` in the parent mangascrapy directory. 
Downloads files to desired folder and renames them to page numbers.

## To-do
TLDR; a lot. 

- More user-friendly interface.
- Auto-zipping of downloaded images with manga name and chapter number.
- Sourcing manga name and chapter number from provided url.
- Support for further manga hosting sites.

## Licensing
Protected under the MIT license. 

TLDR; Do what you want with it, I'm not liable, etc, don't be an ass, etc. etc.
